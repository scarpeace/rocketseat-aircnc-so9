## ðŸ’» Project

AirCNC is a project that connects people that need to rent rooms for Dev and meeting events with people that already have a room to rent. I was made during the 9Âº Omnistack week presented by RocketSeat. I've learnd a ton about advanced concepts of Reactjs and got in touch with ReactNative using EXPO witch just blew mind showing me that styling and elements positioning is really easy due to FlexBox and other tools that are really similar to Reactjs. It was really fun to make and really challenging as well.
